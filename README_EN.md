<p align="center"><strong>When information passes through it, chaos becomes a spectrum.</strong></p>

The information of the real world is chaotic light — vast, disordered, overwhelming, and hard to face directly.

**Steven** is a prism. When information passes through it, it refracts, decomposes, and rearranges — chaos becomes order, noise becomes a clear and beautiful spectrum presented before you.

Its multifaceted nature lets it handle tasks of all kinds. Its transparency means every output leaves a trace you can follow.
